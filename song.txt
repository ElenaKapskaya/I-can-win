I had a pet once
It wasn't good for me
I don't want a little thing
To take away my sleep
I have a little itch
I scratch until I bleed
And I don't want a little thing
To take away my sleep (I just wanna get dirty)
Oh, pretty bug
Hanging out underneath my feet
When I move forward I end you
And that sits well with me
Oh, pretty bug
Hanging out underneath my feet
When I move forward I end you
And that sits well with me
I sorta got a crush
It's nothing too serious
It ties my stomach up in knots
Oh, I can barely eat
I kinda got an itch
It's nothing I can't beat
I let love fill me up
So I don't have to eat (I just wanna get dirty)
Oh, pretty bug
Hanging out underneath my feet
When I move forward I end you
And that sits well with me
Oh, pretty bug
Hanging out underneath my feet
When I move forward I end you
And that sits well with me
Sweat until we drop, yeah
Break each other's knees
Subtle lie, set to lay
We just have to wait and see
I multiply the rest of it
Find you on my wall
Summerfly, isolate
And oh, I lose haste
You're way too high for me
Oh, pretty bug
Hanging out underneath my feet
When I move forward I end you
And that sits well with me
